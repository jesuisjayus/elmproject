### Project Description

This teamwork was carried out within the framework of the ELP project (___E___*cosystèmes des* ___L___*angages de* ___P___*rogrammation*, programming 
language ecosystems) taught in the telecommunication department of INSA Lyon. ([more about ELM project](https://github.com/troussil/elp/tree/master/elm/projet))


The aim of this project is to learn the basics of 3 programming languages([JS](https://github.com/jesuisjayus/jsproject "jsproject"),[Go](https://github.com/jesuisjayus/goproject "goproject") & ELM) and to produce a functional program.

As far as ELM project is concerned, we had to create a little guessing game. The principle is very simple : a word is randomly selected from a list of
1000 common words, only the definition is displayed and you have to guess the word it refers to. Each time you refresh the page, a new definition appears !

### How to run and use the program 

0. First, make sure ELM is installed on your device (if not, check this [page](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html))
1. Download the code and unzip it
2. Go in __src__ file and open a terminal
3. Type `elm reactor` and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
4. You now have access to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) which is actually this game
5. Try to guess the word !
6. You can also find our game [here](https://guessitbgs.000webhostapp.com/ "Guess It !")
